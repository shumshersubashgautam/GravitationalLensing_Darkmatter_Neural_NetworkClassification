# Gravitational Lensing Darkmatter Neural Network Classification
Strong Lensing Challenge - Multi-Class Classification
Gravitational lensing has been a cornerstone in many cosmology experiments and studies since it was discussed in Einsteinâ€™s calculations back in 1936 and discovered in 1979, and one area of particular interest is the study of dark matter via substructure in strong lensing images. We focus on exploring the potential of supervised models in identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure.

This is an example notebook for the Multi-Class Classification.In this notebook, we demonstrate a simple CNN model implemented using the PyTorch library to solve the task of multi-class classification of strong lensing images.

# Dataset
The Dataset consists of three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, spherical substructure, and vortex substructure. The images have been normalized using min-max normalization, but you are free to use any normalization or data augmentation methods to improve your results.

# Evaluation Metrics
ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AUC score (Area Under the ROC Curve)
The model performance will be tested on the hidden test dataset based on the above metrics.
